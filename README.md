# PaperGraph

This repository is a mess and should not be even considered useful. Need to come back to this project someday. I am pretty sure it would help Arxiv-Sanity in some way for reranking papers.

~~This program creates a searching graph of all the papers that are referenced by any given scientific paper.~~
